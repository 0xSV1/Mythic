To add a new C2 Profile:
Create a new directory in this folder with the name of the profile you're going to use (ex: twitter).
Inside of that directory:
	Your server side will be called "{profile name}_server.py"
	For each client side version you support (such as apfell-jxa, apfell-app, apfell-macho, etc):
		create a new folder with that type. Inside of this folder, you'll have your code with the same name as your profile.

Example:
My profile name is twitter, and I created client-side versions for apfell-jxa and apfell-macho. Thus, I should have the following structure:
Apfell/app/c2profiles/twitter
Apfell/app/c2profiles/twitter/twitter_server.py
Apfell/app/c2profiles/twitter/apfell-jxa
Apfell/app/c2profiles/twitter/apfell-jxa/twitter.js
Apfell/app/c2profiles/twitter/apfell-macho
Apfell/app/c2profiles/twitter/apfell-macho/twitter.txt

All profile names need to be unique and setup in this format. Once you have this structure, you need to register this profile with the server (see the c2profiles section of the commandline help within Apfell for guidance on how to hit the API, or do it through the GUI). The registration just needs a name, but I use the name to traverse this directory structure, so it needs to be set up and registered before you can use it.

default is already taken as the default C2 profile (RESTful), so it won't have the default_server.py since that's already the main Apfell server that's running.
